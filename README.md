## Permissions

An app for displaying Privacy Alerts for iOS 7 and greater.

### Build

For simplicity, the Permissions target is linked with Calabash when the app is
built with the **Debug** configuration.

```
1. $ git clone git@github.com:Oddj0b/Permissions.git
2. $ cd Permissions
3. $ make app       # Calabash-app/Permissions.app
4. $ make ipa       # Calabash-ipa/Permissions.ipa
```
